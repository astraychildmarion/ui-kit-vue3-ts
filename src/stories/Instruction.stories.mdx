# How to add new component to xy-cloud-kit 2.0 ? ðŸ™‹
---

You need 3 stuff:
* `.vue` component file, usually it is under `src/components` repository.
* `.stories.js` storybook's stories file to render storybook.
* `index.ts` , which under `src/components` repository.

###  Step 1: Create stories file and .vue file.
Import .vue file into stories file, edit `title: 'UI-KIT/a new name'` in stories file, then you would see new stories show up in siderbar.
### Step 2: Development components
Now you can develop components in storybook.
### Step 3: Update index.ts
`index.ts` is a catalog for components. Vite build would take index.ts as an entry and build components under catalog.   
```
export { default as XYxxxx } from './**/xxxx.vue';
```
